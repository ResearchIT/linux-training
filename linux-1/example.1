# Instructions

For this example, you will need to use what we have learned today to create a 
file in the ~/examples directory named:

    output-example-1


This file should contain the last five (5) lines from:
    ~/examples/files/bill-of-rights

# Checking your work
#=====

Once you have created the file, you should 'cd' to ~/examples and type 

    bin/check1


If you have completed the exercise correctly, you should see something that
resembles the following:

---
[bbritt@training examples]$ check1
 ✓ Is my pwd ~/examples?
 ✓ Does the file output-example-1 exist?
 ✓ Does the file output-example-1 contain 5 lines?
 ✓ Does the file start with 'Amendment VI'?
 ✓ Does the file end with 'Amendment X'?

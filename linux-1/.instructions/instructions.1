# Title: Example 1 - Using Output Redirects
#=====

For this example, you will need to use what we have learned today to create a
file in the current directory named:

    output-example-1


This file should contain the last five (5) lines from:
    files/bill-of-rights

# Checking your work

Once you have created the file, you should type

    check 1


If you have completed the exercise correctly, you should see something that
resembles the following:

---
[bbritt@training examples]$ check 1
 ✓ Does the file output-example-1 exist?
 ✓ Does the file output-example-1 contain 5 lines?
 ✓ Does the file start with 'Amendment VI'?
 ✓ Does the file end with 'Amendment X'?

# Title: Example 5 - Pipelines and Iterative development
#=====

We will be using the file:

    ./files/box-office-domestic

You will need to use what we have learned today to create a file in the current
directory named:

    us-box-office-25-50

This file should contain the information about the 25th - the 50th top
domestic box office films.

If done correctly, the output should look something like this. (NOTE: there will be
26 total lines in your file, I truncated this file for brevity)

Hint 1:
For part 1, I was able to accomplish this task with 2 piped commands and one
redirect:
  command | command > redirect

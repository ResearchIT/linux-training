# Instructions
# Title: Example 5
#=====

The instructions for this example are going to be in two parts.

#
# Part 1
For this part, you will need to use what we have learned today to create a
file in the ~/examples directory named:

    us-box-office-25-50

This file should contain the information about the 25th - the 50th top
domestic box office films.

If done correctly, the output should look something like this. (NOTE: there will be
25 total lines in your file, I truncated this file for brevity)

26      The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King   NL      $377,845,905    2003
27      Spider-Man 2    Sony    $373,585,825    2004
28      The Passion of the Christ       NM      $370,782,930    2004

# Part 2
Once we have done this, we want to total the box-office earnings for all of
these films. We will put this into a file named:

    us-box-office-25-50-total

To do this, we need to do at least 5 commands, each piped to the next command.

Here was how I did it:
  1) First, we need to read the us-box-office-25-50 file
  2) Next, we take the input of that command, and print out the 4th field
     (which is the total amount earned)
  3) Then, we need to take out the '$' from the output, since the command
     we are going to use -- bc -- does not allow dollar signs in the input
  4) After that, we need to take out the commas -- , --  just like we took out
     the dollar signs
  5) Finally, we're going to pipe all of that into the following command:
        paste -s -d"+" | bc

The paste command takes all of lines and appends a 'delimiter' to it (-d).
The delimiter we will use is the addition sign '+'. Also, the (-s) option
to paste removes all of the new-lines and puts everything into one line.

The bc command is a simple command-line calculator that will evaluate
the mathematical expression.

It greatly helps to do all of this iteratively, meaning first I read the file.
After I do that, I add the next part of the pipeline and look at the output.
After that output looks good, then I add the next part of the pipeline, and
so on and so forth... :)

So, when I get done, if I look at the history, I can see the progression of
development.

(read us-box-office-25-50)
(read us-box-office-25-50) | (only print the 4th field)
(read us-box-office-25-50) | (only print the 4th field) | (remove Dollar Signs)
(read us-box-office-25-50) | (only print the 4th field) | (remove Dollar Signs) | (remove commas)
(read us-box-office-25-50) | (only print the 4th field) | (remove Dollar Signs) | (remove commas) | paste -s -d"+"
(read us-box-office-25-50) | (only print the 4th field) | (remove Dollar Signs) | (remove commas) | paste -s -d"+" | bc


#=====
# Checking your work
#=====

Once you have created the file, you should 'cd' to ~/examples and type

    check 5

If all of the tests pass, then you have successfully completed this example.

# Hints
#=====

Hint 1:
For part 1, I was able to accomplish this task with 2 piped commands and one
redirect:
  command | command > redirect

Hint 2:
For part 2, it is easiest to work on the development iteratively, as mentioned
above. I've already given you the strangest-looking part of the pipeline:
  ... paste -s -d"+" | bc

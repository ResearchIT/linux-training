# Instructions
# Title: Example 4
#=====

For this example, you will need to use what we have learned today to create two
files in the current directory named:

    sorted.numerical
    sorted.text

You will be working with the file:

    ./files/numbers-to-sort

Linux can do some funny things when it comes to sorting, and we're going to
look at that while learning about pipes and redirects.

First, you need to sort the file numerically. Put the output of the numerical
sort into the file named

    sorted.numerical

Second, you need to sort the same file using a "dictionary", or text, sort.
Put the output of the dictionary sort into a file named

    sorted.text


#=====
# Checking your work
#=====

Once you have created the file, you should 'cd' to ~/examples and type

    check 4

If all of the tests pass, then you have successfully completed this example.

# Hints
#=====

Hint :
We will (obviously) be using the 'sort' command for this example. Be sure
to look at the man page for 'sort' and read all of the options that it
can handle.

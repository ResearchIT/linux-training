#=====
# Instructions
#=====

For this example, you will need to use what we have learned today to create a 
file in the ~/examples directory named:

    ALLCAPS


This file should contain the full text of the following files in ALL capital 
letters:
    1) ~/examples/declaration-of-independence
    2) ~/examples/bill-of-rights

#=====
# Checking your work
#=====

Once you have created the file, you should 'cd' to ~/examples and type 

    bin/check3

If all of the tests pass, then you have successfully completed this example.

# Hints

Hint 1:
The 'tr' command is not only able to translate one character, but multiple
characters at a time. You can actually give it a 'range'

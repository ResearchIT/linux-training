# Instructions
#=====
For this example, you will need to use what we have learned today to create a 
file in the ~/examples directory named:

    output-example-2


This file should contain the first 5 lines of the declaration of independence 
without "doubled newlines". This file is located at: 
    ~/examples/files/declaration-of-independence


#=====
# Example
#=====
For example, the original first 5 lines looks like this

---
IN CONGRESS, JULY 4, 1776 
The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America

When in the Course of human events it becomes necessary for one people
to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another
---

Your output should look like this

---
IN CONGRESS, JULY 4, 1776 
The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America
When in the Course of human events it becomes necessary for one people
to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another
and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal

# Checking your work
#=====

Once you have created the file, you should 'cd' to ~/examples and type 

    bin/check2

If all of the tests pass, then you have successfully completed this example.

# Hints
#=====

Hint 1:
Just like in math, order matters. If your output-example-2 file only contains
4 lines, then you need to consider the order in which you are running your 
piped commands.

Hint 2:
I was able to accomplish this task with 3 piped commands:
  command | command | command

Hint 3:
The 'tr' command has some really neat options. You should check them with
'man tr' on the command line.
